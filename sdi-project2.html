<p>The topic for my project is my trip that I just took to Moab. I chose this theme because I had a wonderful time last weekend.</p>
<p>Moab is a city in Utah that has many nearby State and National Parks and there are lots of outdoor adventures to go on there. The desert there is very scenic and diverse.</p>
